//! Extension traits that allow you to add physics events.
//!
//! This crate doesn't add any events, but you can easily add your own (e.g. collisions).
//!
//! This extension introduces event channels, on one side of which is `mpsc::Sender<T>`,
//! and on another side is bevy's `EventReader<T>`, and it automatically bridges between the two.
//! This feature is needed to get information from physx callbacks to bevy world.
//!
//! See discussion in <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/8983>.
